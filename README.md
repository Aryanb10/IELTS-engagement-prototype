# 🎯 IELTS Momentum Builder – Working Prototype

## 📌 Overview
**IELTS Momentum Builder** is an engagement-focused prototype designed to help students stay consistent and motivated during long IELTS preparation cycles.

This project was created as part of a product case study to improve user engagement in an IELTS preparation platform. The prototype demonstrates how small daily tasks, progress tracking, and habit-building mechanisms can increase user activity, course completion, and score improvement.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Many IELTS learners:
- Start preparation late  
- Study inconsistently

This prototype explores how a structured engagement system can help users stay active from the beginning of their preparation journey.

The goal is to make IELTS preparation feel manageable, rewarding, and consistent.
